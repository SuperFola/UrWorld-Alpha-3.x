Description: About PySDL2
        ============
        PySDL2 is a wrapper around the SDL2 library and as such similar to the
        discontinued PySDL project. In contrast to PySDL, it has no licensing
        restrictions, nor does it rely on C code, but uses ctypes instead.
        
        Installation
        ============
        PySDL2 is easy to install and integrate within your own projects. Just
        follow Python's standard procedure of installing packages or look for a
        prebuilt package for your operating system or distribution.
        
        Documentation
        =============
        If you just started with SDL and PySDL2, it is strongly recommended
        that you read through the tutorial of the documentation to learn the 
        basics. You can find the documentation at *doc/html* or online at
        http://pysdl2.readthedocs.org.
